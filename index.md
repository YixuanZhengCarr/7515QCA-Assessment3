<!--- PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case. This should be suitable for a catalog, poster, or other display material about the project. --->

<!--- SECONDARY IMAGE: Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else. This should not just be a different angle of the same object. It should show the project in use if the first image didn't show that, or somehow tell us a different story about the project. --->

This project is about a mask that expresses emotion. It's done by a light that's mounted on the mask.

In the first half of 2020, due to the impact of the epidemic, people have put on masks and prevented the threat of disease for their own health and safety. But at the same time people lose something very important in the process of communication, and that is the expression. This emotional mask is designed for people to communicate with each other in an epidemic situation. Hopefully, it'll add a little bit of fun to their conversation.

Show expressions and emotions by changing the color or shape of the light. It's like the emoji people add to their text messages. To make the conversation more interesting.
