This project is about a mask that expresses emotion. It's done by a light that's mounted on the mask.

In the first half of 2020, due to the impact of the epidemic, people have put on masks and prevented the threat of disease for their own health and safety. But at the same time people lose something very important in the process of communication, and that is the expression. This emotional mask is designed for people to communicate with each other in an epidemic situation. Hopefully, it'll add a little bit of fun to their conversation.

Show expressions and emotions by changing the color or shape of the light. It's like the emoji people add to their text messages. To make the conversation more interesting.
